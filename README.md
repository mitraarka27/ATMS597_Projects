# ATMS597_Projects
Examples of Machine Learning Applications of Climate and Weather Data in Python for ATMS597 class - Data Science for Weather and Climate.. 

Project 3: Analysis of climate anomalies over Jakarta, Indonesia ground station observations.

Project 4 : Use sets of prior weather station data and meteorological observations in ML Regression Models to predict future $T_{min}$, $T_{max}$, $w_{min}$, $w_{max}$, $P_{tot}$ etc. That is, temperature, winds and total precipitation. Used Linear Regression and Random Forest.

Project 6: Analysis of MOD08_M3 (Monthly Mean MODIS Cloud Data) and ERA5 Reanalysis to build optimized ANN models to predict future cloud-top height, cloud liquid droplet effective radius and cloud ice fraction anomalies. 

I acknowledge my collaborators (names included in each report) on these projects.
